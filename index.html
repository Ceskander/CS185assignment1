				Hi my name is Crystal Eskander! I'm a fourth-year undergraduate student pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Engineering from UC Santa Barbara.
			</p>

			<p> 
				I have professional experience in Software Engineering through my internships at Northrop Grumman and Amazon. I have served as a Logistics Coordinator for SB Hacks for 3 years, a 500-person event that brings students from all over California to the heart of UCSB for an innovation-filled weekend.
